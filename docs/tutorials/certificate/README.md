# Certificate

Voyager comes with a built-in certificate manager that can issue free TLS/SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.


Voyager can automatically provision and refresh SSL certificates issued from Let's Encrypt using a custom Kubernetes Certificate resource.

Features

Provision free TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt,
Manage issued certificates using a Kubernetes Third Party Resource,
Domain validation using ACME dns-01 challenges,
Support for multiple DNS providers,
Auto Renew Certificates,
Use issued Certificates with Ingress to Secure Communications.


Let's Encrypt issued certificates are automatically created for each Kubernetes Certificate object. This
tutorial will walk you through creating certificate objects based on the googledns.






Voyager manages certificates objects to create Certificates default from Let's Encrypt.

### Core features of AppsCode Certificates:
  - Creates and stores Certificate from Let's Encrypt ot any custom provider supports ACME protocol
  - Auto renew certificate before expiration
  - Uses HTTP provider to issue certificate with HTTP request
  - Domain validation using ACME dns-01 challenges.
  - Support for multiple DNS providers.


### Supported Providers
[This Providers](providers.md) are supported as domain's DNS provider. The `providerCredentialSecretName` Must match the
format.

## Usage
- [Creating a Certificate](create.md)
- [Deleting a Certificate](delete.md)

## Using Certificate with Ingress

For sakes of simply managing ingress with TLS termination we can create a ingress with some Annotation that can be used
to create and or manage a certificate resource with Voyager controller. Read More with [Ingress](../ingress/tls.md)

Read the example how to use [HTTP Provider](/docs/tutorials/certificate/create.md#create-certificate-with-http-provider)
for certificate.



## Deleting a Certificate
Deleting a Kubernetes Certificate object will only delete the certificate CRD from kubernetes.
It will not delete the obtained certificate and user account secret from kubernetes. User have to manually delete
the secrets for removing those.

### Delete Certificate
```
kubectl delete certificate test-cert
```

**Delete Obtained Lets Encript Certificate**
```
kubectl delete secret cert-test-cert
```

**Delete Lets Encrypt User Account Secret**
```
kubectl delete secret test-user-secret
```
